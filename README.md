# Investment Strategy Optimization - Group 7

## Overview
This project uses advanced optimization algorithms to tackle two key problems:

1. **Investment Strategy Optimization**:
   - **Objective**: Maximize the Sharpe ratio for investments in three companies.
   - **Method**: Implemented the Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) algorithm to iteratively adjust investment allocations and maximize risk-adjusted returns.

2. **Queueing Model Optimization**:
   - **Objective**: Minimize the average waiting time in a GI/GI/1 queueing system.
   - **Method**: Utilized a Stochastic Approximation (SA) algorithm to optimize service times, ensuring efficient customer service and reduced waiting times.
